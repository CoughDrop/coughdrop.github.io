<h3>Welcome to the AAC Partnership</h3>
	<p>AAC implementations are an ongoing process, not a buy-and-you're-done
    transaction. At CoughDrop we understand this, and we collaborate with organizations
    both large and small to support their unique needs and to improve
    the lives of their clients -- whether they currently choose CoughDrop or not.

        <h2>Nobody Through the Cracks</h2>
        <p>
          The AAC implementation process is unique to each individual, both
          in timing and in their final choice of app, vocabulary, etc. CoughDrop
          site licenses allow you to support <b>all</b> AAC users in a single
          view, and to create vocabularies or templates that can be used by
          any staff member on their own device, on a projector, or with printed
          copies so AAC can easily reach everyone who can benefit.

        <h2>Optimize Budget</h2>
        <p>
          Let's face it, there are more people who can benefit from AAC supports
          than are currently getting it, but often your budget can only stretch
          far enough to help those with the most need. With a CoughDrop site license you can
          extend the reach of your AAC program beyond a few AAG users. 
          You can re-assign licenses as people come and go, and manage everyone'
          access from a single dashboard.

        <h2>Solve <i>Your</i> Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Every district and institution is unique. You have worked hard
          to implement a solution that makes a difference for the people you
          serve. With a CoughDrop site license you can support AAC users
          regardless of whether they use the CoughDrop AAC app or something
          else. You can organize your teams in the way that makes sense for you,
          and leverage the existing devices you have implemented.

        <h2>Keep Everyone Improving</h2>
        <p>
          Continuing education is an ongoing process, and making sure everyong
          is up-to-date on industry best-practices can feel like a tall order.
          With a CoughDrop site license you'll find built-in tools to organize
          your staff and clients, and easy-to-use profiling and evaluation
          tools to measure growth and learning over time. You can set
          room-level goals and check progress towards those goals for each
          individual -- no matter what type of AAC they use -- 
          so no one gets left behind.
