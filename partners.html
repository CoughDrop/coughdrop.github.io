	<h5>Bluetooth Speakers</h5>
	<p>Some devices don't have loud enough speakers, or have speakers that point the wrong direction so they don't help a communicator speak effectively. Bluetooth speakers can be used with CoughDrop to facilitate communication, and even to make using CoughDrop just a little more fun.</p>
