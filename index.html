								<h2>Every voice should be heard</h2>
								<p>Some people are hard to hear -- through no fault of their own. Disabilities like autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Rett syndrome make it harder for many individuals to communicate on their own. Powerful software called Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) can fill the gaps and make every voice heard.</p>
                <p>At CoughDrop we work to help bring out the voices of those with complex communication needs through powerful open-source technology that easily adapts to the individual and supports everyone around them trying to help them succeed.</p>
