	<h3>There's Plenty of Work To Do</h3>
	<p>Augmentative and Alternative Communication has been around for a long time. Some strategies and
	  solutions have been well-proven over the years, but there is a strong need for continued 
	  innovation and collaboration.
	</p>
	<p>At CoughDrop we believe that Assistive Technology is important enough that we have better things
	  to worry about than how to keep customers paying more and more money for proprietary locked-in
	  solutions. We work hard to learn from others and share what we've learned, all in the open so
	  we all can benefit. We don't pretend to know all the answers, and lean heavily on community experts
	  and families to help us keep building in a way that can make the most difference.
	</p><p>
	  A major part of our company DNA is to go out into
	  the field and find out everyone else's answers to our questions, instead of just relying on our
	  own perspective. That's how CoughDrop got started in the first place, and we keep doing it today.
	  Below are some of the projects we've collaborated on.

        <h2>Message Banking</h2>
        <p>For individuals with degenerative scenarios or social anxieties having pre-recorded messages
          instead of synthesized speech can be valuable and convenient. 
          <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/ALSmessagebanking" target='_blank'>John Costello at Boston 
          Children's</a> is a pioneer in the work of effective message banking. We
          are actively working with John and his team to develop novel solutions to the difficulty of
          recording and transferring large collections of sound files.</p>

        <h2>Getting Social</h2>
        <p>Jill Senner and Matt Baud work hard to advocate for communicators in the AAC space,
          to make sure they get the communication supports that they need to succeed. We have collaborated
          with them on new ways to efficiently track Partner-Augmented Input and 
          to create a set of <a href="http://www.talcaac.com/pages.html" target="_blank">Social Pages</a>
          that can be used with CoughDrop.</p>

        <h2>Core Strength</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.project-core.com/" target="_blank">Project Core</a> is a powerful resource
          for implementing and supporting core vocabulary for AAC communicators. We have worked with
          Project Core to implement their sample communication boards, and will continue to leverage
          their expertise in the development of our core word-based resources in the
          <a href="https://workshop.openaac.org" target='_blank'>Communication Workshop</a>.</p>

        <h2>Let's Ask More Questions</h2>
        <p>AAC research can be challenging, often because of a lack of good data. 
          Because CoughDrop is in the cloud, we can provide 
          <a href="https://app.mycoughdrop.com/trends" target='_blank'>interesting insights</a> based on
          hard data.
          Many CoughDrop users opt-in to anonymized contribution to research projects 
          in the hopes of improving our understanding
          of AAC around the world. If you are interested in collaborating to answer new
          questions, please let us know!</p>
