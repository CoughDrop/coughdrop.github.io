	<h3>Starting on the Right Foot</h3>
	<p>CoughDrop started simply enough. Brian Whitmer, a software developer and entrepreneur, was
	  trying to find a good communication system for his daughter who had been diagnosed with
	  Rett Syndrome. Because of his background in usability he kept getting frustrated with poor
	  design decisions and old technology, so he collaborated with over 30 SLPs, OTs and AT specialists
	  to build something better. The result was CoughDrop.

	<h3>Keeping Things Open</h3>
	<p>
	  Before long Brian found Scot Wahlquist, whose son is nonverbal with autism, and the two
	  kept working to make CoughDrop more effective for individuals with any communication need.
	  They felt like too many providers were trying to "lock in" their customers with proprietary
	  solutions and high prices, so they wanted to fix that.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As a result, CoughDrop is open source, and incorporates open-licensed content like free 
	  symbols and community-generated boards, and all our vocabulary sets 
	  are released under a Creative Commons license.
	  That way we can easily collaborate with and publicly share resources with teams around
	  the world in order to keep raising the bar.

	<h3>Staying In the Know</h3>
	<p>CoughDrop isn't just a communication system for individuals, it's also a collaboration
	  tool for the many people who support each communicator. With built-in reports and goals 
	  as well as a messaging and video-recording tool, teams can make sure they're on the same
	  page and working effectively.
	</p>
	<p>One of the biggest barriers to success with AAC is buy-in from the support team. When
	  families don't know how they're supposed to help or staff and aides aren't comfortable
	  using the system, AAC usage suffers or sometimes stops altogether. That's why we provide
	  details reports on how and when communication is happening, but also follow it up with
	  email updates and ideas and suggestions that the whole team can incorporate to be more successful.

	<h3>Moving Things Forward</h3>
	<p>In the end, we here at CoughDrop don't really think there is an end. We're constantly
	  working to find ways to improve, and new components like built-in reading materials
	  and third-party integrations to keep supporting the needs of communicators. And we'll 
	  always do it out in the open, where everyone can see and benefit because, well, that's
	  just part of who we are. This work is too important for us to waste time trying to 
	  lock people in instead of giving them the freedom to communicate in the way that works
	  best for them. We get that because that's the reason we're here in the first place.
